* Implement acopost as a library
** Make main functions re-entrant and avoid global variables
* Support UTF-8
  Currently util.c, tbt.c, t3.c, met.c, et.c contain hard-coded
  latin1 strings, that are used to deal with ä, ö, ü, Ä, Ö, and Ü
  there is no support for other common latin1 symbols, nor for
  unicode.
  Complete UTF-8 support would be a good option to improve that
  code.
