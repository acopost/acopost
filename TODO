* Remove segmentation faults
* Uniform the binaries CLI
  we already added prefixes, so it should not be a big issue trying to make
  the options more uniform and changing the CLI; we should however write
  a manual to cope with the differences in the interface.
* Update UserGuide
* Implement acopost as a library
** Make main functions re-entrant and avoid global variables
*** tokenizer/strtok (tokenizer revert the changes to the input string when
    finished)
*** substr
*** lowercase
** No library function should call exit
   Currently the only functions doing this are try_to_open() and the
   functions calling it
* Support UTF-8
  Currently util.c, tbt.c, t3.c, met.c, et.c contain hard-coded
  latin1 strings, that are used to deal with ä, ö, ü, Ä, Ö, and Ü
  there is no support for other common latin1 symbols, nor for
  unicode.
  Complete UTF-8 support would be a good option to improve that
  code.
