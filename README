This is ACOPOST, "A COllection of POS Taggers".  

Part-of-speech tagging is the task of assigning symbols from a
particular set to words in a natural language text. ACOPOST implements
and extends well-known machine learning techniques and provides a
uniform environment for testing.

Originally written by Ingo Schr√∂der, ACOPOST is now maintained by a
team of developers, and has a home at:
